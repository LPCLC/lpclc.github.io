          <h2 style="padding-top: 20px;">Meet Joe Smith</h2>
          <p1>This November, Liberty County voters will elect a candidate to oversee the County Council. With increasing
            regulations on small businesses and financial waste of taxpayer dollars in projects that lead nowhere, the
            need for a libertarian candidate to oversee our money. The premise is simple: live and let live, and make
            sure each dollar spent brings a dollar of value back.</p1>
          <p1>Welcome to the campaign hub for Joe Smith, your candidate for County Alderman! Joe Smith embodies the
            principles of classical liberalism and libertarianism, dedicated to promoting pragmatic liberty and
            accountability within our local community.</p1>

        <h2 style="color: #FAF0CA;">Business Regulations</h2>
        <p1 style="color: #FAF0CA;">The world runs on commerce, money, and free trade of goods and labor. At a basic
          level, labor income is the lifeline of a family's household. When the Government restricts the ability of a
          person to transact business or work in certain industries, it makes more difficult the life of the household.
          Except when absolutely needed, the Government should have no ability to restrict businesses with added
          regulations.<br><br>Liberty County's Council has repeatedly voted to require more bureaucracy paperwork for
          small businesses during nationwide economic turmoil. Joesph Smith will never vote to increase business taxes
          or other regulations in Liberty County.</p1>

        <h2 style="color: #FAF0CA;">Localized Fiscal Responsibility</h2>
        <p1 style="color: #FAF0CA;">Last year, the Liberty County Council spent thousands of dollars on attorneys fees to investigate an ethics complaint against one of their own Aldermen. Weeks later, the attorney resigned the case, citing the irresponsible and personally repulsive behavior of the council. Following this resignation, another attorney was retained who had to begin their work from square one. This feat led to a complete and utter waste of taxpayer dollars because Liberty County's Council couldn't maintain professionalism for a serious matter.<br><br>Every dollar brought into Liberty County's control was done by theft: all taxation is theft. If they're going to wasting the money, they don't deserve it. At the very least, every dollar should produce a dollar's worth of value. Joseph Smith will stretch every dollar possible so as to avoid increasing taxes.</p1>
